# instasoup
A simple instagram scraper written with python using Beautiful Soup.

## Usage
Download the insta_soup.py file to your local machine. Run python command with an argument of instagram username.
```
python insta_soup.py username
```
The script will create a new directory and store profile picture, photos and video into it.

## Issue
The script can only scrap the latast 12 posts. I have no idea how to get those further posts, and everytime I try to request them I get a 403 code.
